                                We hired Perfecent to build our website. We were assigned Bill to work with. Bill was
                                excellent!! He was very patient and attentive. Bill was able to incorporate our ideas
                                into
                                the perfect website! He even gave us suggestions that made our website even better than
                                we
                                anticipated. The customer service at Perfecent is wonderful! During our development Bill
                                took a little time off to get married. (Yes girls he’s married!) While he was gone Taqi
                                covered for him. I was a little concerned to have Bill gone but Taqi stepped right in
                                and we
                                never missed a beat! Taqi was as knowledgeable as Bill and was very helpful in helping
                                us to
                                continue to move forward until Bill returned. The teams they have at Perfecent are all
                                very
                                skilled and informed. If you need a website don’t waist your time try to find someone
                                better
                                because you won’t! Go to Perfecent and get it done quick and right!! You won’t regret
                                it!!</p>

                                having a great website. I will continue to do business with them in updating my website
                                in the long term and possibly their other services they may offer. Perfecent designed my

                                couple thousands of dollars. If you want to create a website from scratch I recommend

                                retreat ministry. Bill Watson, my project manager at Perfecent designed an excellent
                                website that did this for me. All the people I dealt with at Perfecent were very
                                professional and helpful throughout this process. Bill Watson not only designed the
                                website per my needs and specifications, but he taught me how to manage and edit the
                                site myself. He very patiently taught this newbie how to navigate Word Press.</p>

                                I have recently worked with Saif & Bill at Perfecent on the redesign of our companys’
                                website. To say that they handled everything smoothly, efficiently, on time and on
                                budget would be understating how AMAZING the experience was. It was effortless and
                                painless, for me, the techno phobe. They staged everything on a site and readily made
                                all the little tweaks and changes I requested without any push back. They delivered
                                EXACTLY what we wanted on time and on budget…it was such a pleasant experience and they
                                EXCEEDED my expectations. I’m thrilled to be working them on another project
                                already.</p>

                                Bill at Perfecent was AMAZING to work with. Every detail was PERFECT. He was prompt and
                                courteous. Converting my site from Joomla to WordPress was no small endeavour due to the
                                size of my site and blog. He and his team were full of helpful insights and suggestions
                                that made my new site better than I hoped or imagined. It is now easier to manage than
                                ever before too! I would HIGHLY recommend Perfecent for all your website needs. Thank
                                you Bill and Moe.</p>
